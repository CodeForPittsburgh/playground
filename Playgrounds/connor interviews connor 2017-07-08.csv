Personal History Of Site ; I used to come here at the very beginning of college. 
The park was a sunken agora of cracked tile and concrete steps which made their way down towards an dry fountain full of leaves and muck.
There were three long concrete balconies that emerged from one side of the site and stretched far out into the space.
One could imagine fascist speeches being made from those concrete balconies, though when you walked up to them, you found that they were always holding five or six inches of green water - the drains had not been cleaned in years.
I once decided that I would use the site as a place to scare my friend Shawn, who was terrified of moths. I was going to dress as a giant moth man and spook him there.
Lucky for him, the place was razed and a new, beautiful park built.

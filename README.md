# playground
A playground for learning the basics of contributing to a project on Github.

This repo is designed to teach baseline skills to folks who are not interested in installing anything addition on their computers. It limits its scope to those tasks which are achievable entirely in-browser, or which can be done using web-interface file uploads of files which can be built on almost any computing device (CSV files).

## What are the goals of this repo?

Thorough exploration of this repo & the tasks associated with it should give praxis and skill training to students. Desired Learning Outcomes:

* Register a Github Account and know how to get other folks registered for their own accounts.
* Request to become a contributor to Code for Pittsburgh, and get approved.
* Navigate a repository from its front page (and Readme).
* Make rudimentary contributions directly from the web interface, using the New File, Upload Files, and *Edit//Pencil* buttons.
* Perform their own Field Survey with a fellow brigade member
* Contribute that Field Survey directly to the repo.
* Use other tools to create large datasets, and upload those datasets as batched CSV files.

## How is this repo structured?

[Interviews](https://github.com/CodeForPittsburgh/playground/tree/master/Interviews) contains an open forum for trying out a few easy methods of data collection. The themed activity which relates to it is the interviewing of other humans about their childhood play places, with a focus on places that no longer exist, or have been altered significantly from how they were when they were young. This can be done through introspection, if other people are not available.

Other folders will be noted here as they are added.

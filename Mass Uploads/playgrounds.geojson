We used to go to the Chilis that was there, because there wasn't a Chilis in Elkins, WV. It didn't stick out a lot as a kid, but my first job up here was at that collection place in same mall as that Chilis. I would go outside for cigarette breaks and look out at that old run-down Chilis. I kept having memories of this weird bland Chilis we used to eat at, and its weird because I'm working, at work, three hours from home, but there's this childhood Chilis we used to eat at. Malls were definately my playground." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -80.037714, 40.423497 ] } },

That's where they'd always go to shows, becuase it was the closest big venue to Elkins. My first show there, I was five years old, and that was Aretha Franklin and Prince. I don't remember anything, but I've been told I slept through the whole thing. It's changed hands, and they changed the name. It had such a magical name. Why would you change the name, when you had a name like Star Lake Amphitheatre? Why is everything named after a business?" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -80.4363397, 40.4194259 ] } },

Out in Monroeville, there's a couple different pet stores. There's one, it's right across from the Chuck E Cheese, because Chuck E Cheese is the place where my parents had their honeymoon at. I think it was called Elmos. As a kid, going there, my first birthday present ever was a fish tank with a bunch of fish. Every year, we'd go up to the fancy pet store in Pittsburgh, with these huge walls of aquariums, all backlit with lazers and shit. Every wall would be a fish tank, as a kid, so you felt like you'd be completely under water. We went there because that's something my parents did, young, in love, killing time in Pittsburgh, doing all the shit I needed to do myself to get away from my small town, so I wonder why they give me shit about my feeling the need to move to Pittsburgh." }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -79.7727557, 40.4387398 ] } },

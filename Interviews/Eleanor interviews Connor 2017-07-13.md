# Personal History Of Site
Back in college, Connor would go to Lot 190. It was an abandoned house built on the back of a lot in Four Mile Run half way between two sets of houses.
The house was on one of the steepest lots in Pittsburgh - it was 5 stories with a single room on each story!
Connor visited once with a friend and conducted a seance (with no result.)
But for years in the winter when the trees were dead you could see the house from the highway - it was a creepy house that didn't touch any roads and apart from the other houses.

This was my playground when I was a kid. A lot of it is still the same, but a lot of the equipment has changed. Many of the big stainless steel slides have left. The big train is still there, but you can't climb on it any more. I used to play all around it when I was a kid. Looking at it now, there is *so much plastic*. There were a bunch of these cool metal slides and things that are no longer there. Basically, all the things that were dangerous are no longer there.

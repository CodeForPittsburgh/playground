# Personal History Of Site

The current use is as a Big Lots, which sounds like a similar use, but trust me, it is NOT. This would have been my formative years - elementary and middle school, exploring with friends, we would walk or bike over to McFrugals frequently. We didn't have any money, we'd just browse the aisles. It just seemed like a world of possibility, a place where you can be indipendant & assert yourself outside of the home.

The staff there was nice, they didn't pay attention to us, or treat us poorly, though we were touching *everything*. It was a really friendly atmosphere. I did buy stuff there. I bought some reporter's notepads - the kind that flip over the top. I'd take notes on my thoughts, dreams, and adventures.

The paper was pretty flimsy. It was thin and had a sheen that somehow made it flimsier. But I would use them all the time.

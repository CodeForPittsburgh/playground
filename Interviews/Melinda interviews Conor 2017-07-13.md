# Personal History Of Site
I went there for first through eighth grade. I played there during *recess*. It also held *school fairs* and *events* on the lawn. After I graduated my boyscout troup renovated it with new equipment and safety improvements. **And it's still there today!**  I noticed that sometime between then and now, they improved the basketball court.
